# Introduction-to-Data-Science
Introduction to some data science concepts for classification or regression

## Description of Exercises

- Exercise 1
Analysis of the Iris dataset with histograms. Also, I calculate from the number of each class, the highest value of an attribute for each class

- Exercise 2
Two databases were used for study, grades of two classes of a discipline and profile of European football players. Analysis and hypothesis testing were performed on these data (histograms, boxplots, distributions, kurtosis, skew, percentile, quantile and median).

- Exercise 3
Study of the Iris and Wine sets. Through covariance, correlation and PCA (for dimension reduction)

- Exercise 4
Analysis of a dataset of patients with hepatitis. Visualization of outliers with boxplots. Also, handling categorical and numeric features with replacement of missing data (using pipelines and transformers).

- Exercise 4.1
Handling a credit card transaction dataset with oversampling and undersampling. Furthermore, Stratifield K fold validation for some classifiers

- Exercise 5
Study a set of data, using the tools of the previous exercises. Furthermore, use of binary classification metrics (TPR, FPR, TNR, FNR) and confusion matrix.

- Exercise 6
Evaluation and bootstrap measures of several ML models, for this, the ROC curve and the T Test were used. Breast Cancer, Wine and Titanic datasets.
